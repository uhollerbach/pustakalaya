# पुस्तकालय or  `pustakalaya` - a small command-line program to help me manage my books

`pustakalaya` is a small library-management program I'm wrting to help
me manage my books, of which I have too many. It is written in scheme,
and I compile it using the `wile` scheme compiler which is in the next
repository over. "pustakalaya" is a Sanskrit word meaning "book place"
(if google translate and the intertubes didn't lie to me... but they
don't call it *The Net of a Million Lies* for nothing).
